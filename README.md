## Executive summary
### Overview of Findings
- Downtime minute was up trend during Jan - Feb'24, after Feb'24 trends goes down until  end of Apr'24, consistency to production volume in manufacturing.
- However, average minute of downtime has no significant change during productoin period. It means cause of downtime doesn't improve yet.
- Main causation of downtime are 1.Solder clog(40%) 2.Component feed error(27%) 3.Vision system issue(17%) 4.Material shortage(15%)
