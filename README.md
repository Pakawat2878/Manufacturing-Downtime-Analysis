## Project Background

The data set present manufacturing production of electric baord which utilize in air conditioner.

The data set include significant manufacturing downtime causation, downtime minute and scrap units which generated in production. This project throughly analyzes this data in order to uncover critical insight that will improve production efficiency of electrice board production.

Insight and recommendations are provided on followig key areas:
- Production efficiency: Evaluate process efficiency through performance of actual production unit and scrap unit.
- Downtime Analysis: Analyze historical downtime occurrence and downtime causation to identify contribution factor that caused impact to buiness.
- Reccomendation: Provide proposal to improve process efficiency base on insign data analyst.

## Executive summary
### Overview of Findings

- Overall production efficiency is 85%, with generated downtime minute x% of total production minutes, equals to loss of ~6000 electric boards.

- The afternoon shift is the worst performance efficiency(76.51%) along production month period(Jan - Apr'24) and downtime factor also.

-  Solder clog is the most contribution factor of downtime(35% of total causation) with scraping rate 2.64%.

-  

- There's strong correlation between operators experience and production efficiency(coefficient factor: 0.59).

- Found downtime occurence as seansonal in each idividual factor. Prioritize investigation on most severe factor 'solder clog'

### Reccomendation
- Reccomend to deep investigate into 'solder clog' machine to find root cause of issue.
